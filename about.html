                        After you have your business plan in place and are ready to focus on your new online
                        venture, it’s time to start creating your e-commerce web site. The first step is selecting the
                        tools you want to use to design and code your site You can start from scratch and code everything by hand, but this requires solid knowledge
                        of HTML, PHP, MySQL, and other programming languages. To shorten the learning curve, you
                        might want to invest in web design software like Adobe Dreamweaver or Microsoft
                        Expression Web.</br> Depending on what version you buy, these programs can run anywhere
                        from $50 to $300. If you don’t have the budget to spend on software, there are also several
                        free open source options to choose from, including KompoZer and BlueGriffon (formerly
                        Nvu). While they may not offer all of the sophisticated features that paid software does, these
                        open source programs are still powerful and easy to use.
                        Everyone likes different web tools for different reasons, so it’s hard to say which will be
                        the best program for you. However, there are some key elements you should look for in
                        any software.</br>
                        An easy-to-use interface is important, especially if you’re less familiar with HTML and would
                        prefer to work with a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) application. WYSIWYG HTML
                        editors allow you to design your site by clicking and dragging elements and inserting text
                        Before You Start Creating
                        Your Site.</br></p>
